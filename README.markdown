About Pynt
==========

This is the software repository for the Python NDL Toolkit (pynt).
[NDL](http://www.science.uva.nl/research/sne/ndl/) is the Network Description Language, a set of RDF schemas to describe multi-layer network topologies, created by the [System and Network Engineering researchgroup](http://www.science.uva.nl/research/sne/) of the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl/).

Pynt is a Python library that provides tools to create the underlying objects of network topologies. These can then be exported to NDL, or Graphviz formats.
There are also libraries for importing information from different sources, such as NDL, some devices, OSPF(-TE) packet dumps, or the [InterDomain Controller](http://www.controlplane.net/) topology format.

Pynt also implements some algorithms to do pathfinding in multi-layer networks.
